                <h3><span>The Best PHP Blogs</span></h3>
                <p>
                    PHP is one of the most commonly used programming languages for web development, so I set out to find the best PHP blogs actively publishing content today. Each of these sites demonstrates technical expertise, is relatively easy to comprehend, publishes content consistently, and has stood the test of time.

                   <h3><span>laravel News</span></h3>
                   <p>
                    Laravel News is a blog for everything surrounding the open-source PHP web framework. It combines a variety of topics but relies heaviest on developer articles and framework updates. There are also less-technical articles and occasional sponsored posts, but they are not devoid of value.

                   <h3><span>php architect</span></h3>
                   <p>
                    PHP Architect is the blog for the monthly print magazine on PHP. You can buy a single month’s magazine or subscribe; there is no free content. However, for anyone serious about PHP, there is a plethora of excellent content for technical savants going back to 2002. Each month’s magazine comprises several in-depth articles written by active PHP programmers who meet the background and editorial requirements to be considered authoritative. PHP Architect’s writing is professional-tier and reads as such, while also boasting useful references and examples throughout. Their regular monthly publication schedule allows for consistent content once per month.

                   <p>
                    PHP Builder is a programming resource that has featured articles, programming tutorials, and code samples since 2001. The posts range from beginner to advanced topics with all content created by active PHP developers. However, the writing quality varies with the author. The formatting isn’t great, and I stumbled upon more than one broken link. However, there are a few writers that put in the effort, and it 
                    shows.
